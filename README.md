## Project Overview

**M.A.S.T.E.R.** stands for **Machine Augmented Sketching and Transformative Engineering Resource**. This project combines serverless microservices, AI-powered tools, and advanced engineering features to provide a comprehensive platform for creating and refining designs.

## Features

### Augmented Sketching

- **Smart Sketch Recognition:** Automatically refines and enhances rough sketches into detailed drawings.
- **Style Transfer:** Apply various artistic styles to sketches for unique, visually appealing results.
- **Dynamic Brush Tools:** Customizable brushes that adapt to your drawing techniques.

### Transformative Engineering

- **Automated Design Generation:** Generate complex designs and blueprints from simple inputs.
- **3D Model Integration:** Convert 2D sketches into interactive 3D models for visualization and prototyping.
- **Simulation Tools:** Test and visualize engineering designs under various conditions.

### AI-Enhanced Collaboration

- **Real-Time Collaboration:** Collaborate on sketches and designs in real-time with others.
- **Feedback Integration:** AI-driven collection and integration of feedback to improve designs.

### Intelligent Suggestions

- **Concept Expansion:** AI suggests additional design concepts based on your initial sketches.
- **Error Detection:** Identify and correct common errors in sketches and designs automatically.

### Customization and Personalization

- **Adaptive Interface:** User interface adapts to individual workflows and preferences.
- **Personalized Recommendations:** AI offers tool, technique, and style recommendations based on user history.

### Advanced Analysis Tools

- **Design Analysis:** Analyze sketches and designs for structural integrity and aesthetic balance.
- **Predictive Analytics:** Forecast potential issues and improvements using historical data.

## Architecture

**M.A.S.T.E.R.** utilizes a serverless architecture to ensure scalability and efficiency:

- **Azure Functions:** Implement serverless microservices to handle various tasks, including sketch processing and design generation.
- **Swagger APIs:** Use Swagger for interactive API documentation, making it easy for developers to understand and test endpoints.
- **Bash CLI Wrapper:** A command-line interface for interacting with APIs, automating tasks, and integrating with other tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- [Azure Account](https://azure.microsoft.com) for deploying serverless functions.
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) for running development tools and scripts.
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com) for containerization and deployment.
- [Bash](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/) for using the CLI wrapper.

### Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-org/master.git
   cd master
   ```

2. **Set Up Azure Functions:**

   - Navigate to `azure-functions/README.md` and follow the instructions to deploy and configure Azure Functions.

3. **Set Up Swagger API Documentation:**

   - Review `swagger/README.md` for details on setting up Swagger documentation for your APIs.

4. **Install CLI Wrapper:**

   - Place the provided Bash scripts in a directory included in your `PATH`.

## API Documentation

API endpoints are documented using Swagger. To view and interact with the API documentation:

- **Swagger UI:** [View API Documentation](https://api.example.com/docs)

## Bash CLI Wrapper

To use the M.A.S.T.E.R. APIs from the command line, utilize the Bash CLI wrapper. Basic usage:

```bash
./cli.sh <command> [arguments]
```

### Commands

- `upload`: Upload a sketch file.
- `generate`: Generate a design based on parameters.
- `get-results`: Retrieve results for a specific design.

For more details, see `cli/README.md`.
